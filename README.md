# About the repo
This repo contains 2 map files: one labeled v7 and one using a traditional update numbering scheme (1.1, 1.2, etc.). The map file labeled v7 is for build 146 of Mindustry, the stable version of update 7. Mindustry v7 is no longer recieving changes and as such I will no longer be updating the v7 map.  The numbered map is the one I am actively working on. It should be functional for the latest bleeding-edge Mindustry version (if it's not, send me a message on Discord. My username is "deepspacerunner (ok to ping)").

# Installing the map
To install the map, first download the map file. Use the one appropriate for your Mindustry version, as seen above. Then open Mindustry, go to the Editor tab, and press Import Map at the bottom. Select the map file. You should now see the map appear in your Editor tab. Go back to the main menu, out of the Editor tab. Click Play. Click Custom Game. Select the map. Choose Sandbox Mode and hit Play.
